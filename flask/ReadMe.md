I got the understanding of the ins and outs of creating websites with the latest technologies. I learned how to connect templates to Flask. I was able to connect the Flask Application to HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap based templates.
Also learned to use the Jinja template engine to directly connect my flask application to my front end files to customize my websites.
This includes a fully complete Social Network project that includes, User Logins, Followers, Authentication, Blueprints, Templates, SQL Databases.
