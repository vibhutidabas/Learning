December,2020

I got hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies. At the end of the project I learned how to predict house prices based on house-level features, analyze sentiment from user reviews, retrieve documents of interest, recommend products, and search for images. Through hands-on practice with these use cases, I was able to apply machine learning methods in a wide range of domains.
