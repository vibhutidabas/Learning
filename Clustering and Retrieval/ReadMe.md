By finding similar documents, I examined similarity-based algorithms for retrieval and structured representations for describing the documents in the corpus, including clustering and mixed membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). I implemented expectation maximization (EM) to learn the document clusterings, and see how to scale the methods using MapReduce.
