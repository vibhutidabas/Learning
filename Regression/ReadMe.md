January-March,2021

I explored regularized linear regression models for the task of prediction and feature selection. I was able to handle very large sets of features and select between models of various complexity and also analyzed the impact of aspects of the data, such as outliers, on the selected models and predictions. To fit these models, I implemented optimization algorithms that scale to large datasets.
