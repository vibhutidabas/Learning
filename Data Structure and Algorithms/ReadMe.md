I learned about the basic data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, heaps and some advanced ones such as AVL trees and red-black trees.
Implemented few famous algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, Kruskal algorithm and Prim and Jarnik's algorithms.
